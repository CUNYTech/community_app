function structures

   registerUser(uname, pword)
   loginUser(uname, pword)

      The API folder contains
      1. all api functions and definitions
      2. all functions currently return JSON objects

      For backend testing ground
      1. all functions from api are included and called
         in the app.js file
      2. as of right now you need to connect to specific
         pages to use the functions.
      3. we should make this a little easier soon
